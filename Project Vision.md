# Product Vision – CraftFlow (Working Name)

## 1. What this MVP is

CraftFlow (working name) is a **simple web app for one bakery** to:

- Configure ingredients, recipes, tier sizes, and decoration materials.
- Create custom cake orders with tiers.
- Automatically calculate:
  - Ingredients and basic materials needed.
  - Cost (ingredients + basic materials + labor).
  - Suggested price with a global markup.
- See a clear breakdown they can actually use in the kitchen.

No AI image generation, no multi-tenant, no other industries in this MVP.

The goal is to **learn from real usage quickly**, then expand to:
- Other bespoke categories (woodworking, garments, jewelry, etc.).
- Multi-tenant SaaS.
- AI design ideation and “agentic” helpers.

## 2. Target user

Solo baker or small bakery owner who:

- Does custom cakes.
- Struggles with consistent pricing and cost visibility.
- Wants a simple tool, not a huge ERP.

## 3. Non-goals (for THIS MVP)

- No marketplace / customer portal.
- No AI image generation.
- No multi-tenant (one bakery only).
- No advanced scheduling / Kanban production board.
- No generic “any product” engine yet.

Those are future phases.
